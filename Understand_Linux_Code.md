Access the following Link: [Linux v0.01](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/0.01/source)

The link points to the source code of Linux kernel version 0.01, which is the very first publicly released version of the Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds. Despite its simplicity compared to modern kernels, it still provides a basic structure that can be recognized in today's Linux kernel. Here's an explanation of the key folders and their purposes in this early version of the kernel:

### **Key Folders in Linux Kernel 0.01 Source Code:**

1. **`boot/`**:
   - **Purpose**: This directory contains the bootloader code. The bootloader is responsible for initializing the hardware and loading the Linux kernel into memory. It includes the first code that runs when the system starts up.
   - **Notable Files**:
     - `bootsect.s`: The assembly code that is executed by the BIOS to load the rest of the kernel.
     - `setup.s`: Prepares the system for running the kernel, including setting up memory and CPU state.

2. **`tools/`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains tools that are used for building the kernel or for creating disk images.
   - **Notable Files**:
     - `build.c`: A utility for building the kernel and creating a bootable image.
     - `build.sh`: A script to automate the build process.

3. **`kernel/`**:
   - **Purpose**: This is the core of the Linux kernel, containing the main kernel functions and processes. It includes the code for system calls, process scheduling, and interrupt handling.
   - **Notable Files**:
     - `sched.c`: Implements the process scheduler, responsible for managing CPU time among processes.
     - `sys.c`: Implements system calls, which are the interface between user-space applications and the kernel.
     - `fork.c`: Handles process creation (forking).

4. **`mm/`**:
   - **Purpose**: The memory management subsystem, responsible for managing the system's memory. It includes code for handling paging, memory allocation, and swapping.
   - **Notable Files**:
     - `mem.c`: Handles memory allocation and deallocation.
     - `page.s`: Assembly code for low-level memory management tasks.

5. **`fs/`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains the file system code. It handles file operations like reading, writing, opening, and closing files. This is where the Virtual File System (VFS) is implemented.
   - **Notable Files**:
     - `file_table.c`: Manages the table of open files.
     - `namei.c`: Handles path name resolution (translating file names to file descriptors).
     - `read_write.c`: Implements file read and write operations.

6. **`include/`**:
   - **Purpose**: This directory contains header files that define various constants, data structures, and function prototypes used throughout the kernel. These headers are crucial for linking different parts of the kernel together.
   - **Notable Files**:
     - `asm.h`: Architecture-specific definitions (for x86 assembly).
     - `sched.h`: Declarations related to process scheduling.
     - `fs.h`: Declarations related to file system structures and operations.

7. **`lib/`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains generic library routines that are used across the kernel. These functions are not specific to any one part of the kernel but provide utility functions that are widely used.
   - **Notable Files**:
     - `string.c`: Implements standard string manipulation functions like `strlen`, `strcmp`, etc.
     - `ctype.c`: Functions for handling character classifications, such as `isalpha`, `isdigit`, etc.

8. **`init/`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains the initialization code for the kernel. This code runs during the kernel boot process and sets up the initial state of the system.
   - **Notable Files**:
     - `main.c`: The entry point for the kernel after boot, responsible for initializing the system and starting the first process.

9. **`usr/`**:
   - **Purpose**: This directory is somewhat symbolic in early versions and may contain user-space utilities or example code. In modern kernels, the equivalent would be tools or utilities that are part of the kernel build but not the kernel itself.
   - **Notable Files**: This folder is usually minimal or empty in this early version.

### **Summary**
In Linux kernel version 0.01, the structure is relatively simple but forms the foundation of the more complex and modular structures seen in modern Linux kernels. Each directory in this early kernel serves a distinct purpose, from bootstrapping the system to managing memory, processes, and file systems, reflecting the fundamental tasks that any operating system must perform.
